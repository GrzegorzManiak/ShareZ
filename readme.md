# ShareZ

A Linux tool designed to make screenshots easier, loosely based on [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/).

## Why?

ShareX is a great tool, but it's only available on Windows. I wanted to make a similar tool for Linux, and this is the result.

## Will this actually go somewhere?

Maybe. I'm not sure yet. I'm just making this for fun, I want to learn how to make GUI apps for Linux that aren't Electron apps, 
I also want to get better at using multiple languages in the same project (C++ and Python in this case).

## Goals

- [ ] CLI tool (for scripting)
- [ ] Screen capture (full screen, window, region)
- [ ] Screen recording (full screen, window, region)
- [ ] Image editor (crop, blur, etc)
- [ ] Image uploader (imgur, ShareX custom uploader, etc)
- [ ] Customizable hotkeys
